# Having no clear pattern in the plot, we can describe the shape of a distribution as random
# The data, however, is skewed to the right since the mean is greater than the median.

# Identifying skewness without plotting
mean <- mean(mtcars$disp)
median <- median(mtcars$disp)
mean > median
# As I said before, the plot is right skewed

# outlier
# It is possible to consider displacement 400 bin to be an outlier
# It may be assumed that a vehicle with a 400-displacement engine will be more powerful and perform better than those with smaller displacements or larger displacements above 400.

# An outlier can be found differently using z-scores
# z-score = 3.29 is considered outlier
# Identify which observations appear above 3.29:
which(mtcars$disp > 3.29)
# As we can see, observations 1 to 32 are outliers

# I agree with Few's recommendation regarding outliers.
# According to the textbook, it stated: "Outliers in distributions are almost always found near one end or the other" (233).
# As I discovered it in my graph, I realized that it provided important information, and I recognized that outliers affected the mean and caused it to move toward it.
